we want to study barriers that impede university students from eating healthily and answer the following questions: 

- Are the students in health science degrees more conscious of a balanced diet?

- Is there a difference in food intake patterns of male and female students?

- Do the students who cook for themselves eat healthier?

- Does the socioeconomic status of the student's family impact their food choices?

- Does the location of the student's family home make a difference in their food habits?
 
We used the exploratory analysis approach to find relationships in a dataset comprising observations of food consumption from the inland Spain University of Castilla-La Mancha students. We compared the student's daily food intake in the five food pyramid groups with the recommended servings.
